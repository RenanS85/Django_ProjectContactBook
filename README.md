# Django_ProjectContactBook
Here is a web project build with Django Framework. It is a contact book site, with many features like a Dashboard admin area for example.

<p>Welcome to my project</p>
<h2>Read this below</h2>
<p>THIS PROJECT HAS THE PORPOSE OF SHOW THE CODE ARCTETURE, so I cut the secret key in 'settings.py' and didn't pull the database file, for security reasons. If you wanna use this arcteture you will nedd to do some steps</p>
<p>a) start a new django project with 'django-admin startproject contactBook .'</P>
<p>b) use all files that are avaible here and use all the 'settings.py' configurations, but with your own secret key</p>
<p>c) after take the folders and code files, do the migration in your terminal to create your db.sqlite file</p>

<p>This website uses Python with Django as a Back-End enviroment developer.</p>
<p>Users can register and create contacts with name, last name, e-mail, description and photo(optional) in a Dashboard enviroment.</p>
<p>For Front-End languages HTML and CSS are used with Bootstrap.</p>
